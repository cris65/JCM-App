# JULIET-CLOUD-MAGAZINE-HTML-APP
my HTML app for JULIET 

After using some software to build APP i come out with this idea to make an HTML responsive APP
so i do a Website and make an app using PHONEGAP, i tested on IOS and Android and the APP works good, now i want to publish,
but i have to fix some point that looks to much for me, since i'm not a developer.....

When i install the IPA on the device the APP works correctly, but i'm not able to see the ICON and the Splash screen
i try to follow the Phonegap instruction on the config.xml, that i add in the APP root folder but i'm not albe to get what i whant.

Hope someone can help me on solving thi issue

Thanks Cris
